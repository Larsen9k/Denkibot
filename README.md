# Denkibot
Denkibot is a chatbot powered by Dialogflow

To run this program the whole project needs to be downloaded. Since this project was so huge I had to put it into a .zip file.

The only files I've touched is the file text-client. That is the file which contains all the necessary code for it to run in our GUI connected to Dialogflow servers.
